## What
Linting the automated checking of code for programmatic and stylistic errors.
It is done using a linter, which is a static code analyser.
There are many code linters availabe for various programming languages today.

## Why
Linting reduces errors and improves overall quality of code.
It can help accelerate development and reduce costs by finding errors earlier

## How
Linting is an automated check, it should happen early in development, before code reviews and testing.
That's because it makes code reviews and test processes more efficient by making sure developers are focused on the right things.

## When

* When you use interpreted programming languages
These lack a compiling phase, so linting is effective for ensuring consistent code style and resolving basic code errors.
Compiled languages may need more advanced code analysis on top of linting.

* When you use standard rules
A linter analyses will analyse code against the rules it knows, ensuring your code is consistent and follows all rules.

* When your needs are basic
Linters are good for basic analysis, but not for more sophisticated analysis and metrics.
