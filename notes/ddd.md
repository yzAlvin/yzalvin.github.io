# Domain Driven Design

## What
is an approach to software development that centers the development on programming a domain model that has a rich understanding of the processes and rules of a domain.

The approach is particularly suited to complex domains, where a lot of often-messy logic needs to be organised.

The idea to develop software for a complex domain, we need to build a 'ubiquitous language' that embeds domain terminology into the software systems that we build.

Proponents of Extreme Programming see DDD as a natural component of an XP approach.

Eric Evan's book introduces the notion of classifying objects into:
* Entities
* Value Objects
* Service Objects
