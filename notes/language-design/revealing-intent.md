| Level | Attributes |
| ----- | ---------- |
| L1	| Articulates the different types of ways of revealing intent in code. Comments are frequently used to explain code. |
| L2	| Classes, methods and variables begin to reveal intent in naming however naming is inconsistent and may be confusing to others. Comments are rarely used. |
| L3	| Classes, methods and variable names are named to reveal mainly technical concepts with occasional naming revealing specific domain examples. Comments are very rarely used. |
| L4	| Classes, methods and variable names reference mainly domain concepts with occasional technical concepts. Comments are very rarely used. |

## What is it?

Writing code in such a way that it is easy to read and understand, therefore more maintainable.

## Why

Readability of code is very important.

Comments are not a good way to reveal intent.

Comments should be rarely used, if ever.

Instead of comments, you could name things better, make code smaller, extract functionality.

Naming should be consistent.

Names should reference mainly domain concepts.:
