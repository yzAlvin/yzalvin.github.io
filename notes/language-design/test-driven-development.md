# Learning Rubric

| Level | Attributes |
| ----- | ---------- |
| L1	| Articulates what a test first approach is, why it is useful and the high level red, green, refactor pattern. |
| L2	| Methods/Classes are written in a way that they are unit testable however the tests are largely written post the actual method/class being written. |
| L3	| 	The basic TDD cycle is followed where in general each time new functionality is added to the solution an appropriate test is written first.  |
| L4	| Code is driven by a test first approach. Able to apply discretionary judgement on when to use a top down or bottom up test approach. Able to identify short term tests that help with implementation vs long term tests that prove validity of solution. |
