## What is it?

The SOLID principles try to make software more understandable, flexible and maintainable. They will help code be easier to change, and easier to test.

* Single Responsibility Principle

Class has one role, and therefore only one reason to change.

* Open/Closed Principle

It should be possible to extend a class' behaviour without modifying it

* Liskov Substitution Principle

A derived class can substitute a base class

* Interface Segregation Principle

Interfaces should be fine grained and client specific

* Dependency Inversion Principle

Depend on abstractions, not implementations. Interfaces are abstractions.
