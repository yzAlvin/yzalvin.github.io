There are fixed, mixed and growth mindsets.

Skills and abilities can develop overtime

A fixed mindset believes:
* You can't increase intelligence
* You have a certain level of talent
* Once adulthood, you can't increase your intelligence
* It's hard to continue learning new skills

Relying on talent alone is a trap.

Turn mistakes, failure, and challenges into opportunities to grow.
The best way to find opportunities is to create them.
Everyone has the ability to develop leadership skills.
* Learn as you go
* Ask for feedback
* Be flexible

Studying vs Learning
Post, Present and Future mindsets
