| L3	| Can explain what artefact repositories are and their benefits. The project pushes images to an artefact repository only if the tests pass and build succeeds. |
| L4	| Can articulate the value of having clearly defined and fast build pipelines. Project has clearly defined build steps with seperated concerns, and is optimised to build as quickly as possible. |

## How
Buildkite agents are small, reliable and cross-platform build runners that run automated builds. Buildkite never accesses your code, and does not run any agents, so you need to install and run agents on your own infrastructure. You can do this on you local development machine, an existing CI machine, or a new server.

Every agent comes with a config.

# Containerisation
Docker is an open platform
