# What

Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. 
Encourages teams to learn through experiences
Self-organise while working on a problem
Reflect on their wins and losses to continuously improve
Centered around continuous improvement

Artifacts
Something we make, a tool to solve a problem
* product backlog - essentially a to do list
* sprint backlog - items, user stories, or bug fixes selected by team for implementation in the current sprint cycle.
* increment with definition of "done" 

Be just as agile with the framework as you are with your product.

Ceremonies
Examples:
* organise the backlog / backlog grooming
* sprint planning
* sprint
* daily scrum or stand up
	* what did i do yesterday?
	* what do i plan to do today?
	* are there any obstacles?
* sprint review
* sprint retrospective

Roles
* scrum product owner
	* build and manage the product backlog
	* partner with business and team to ensure everyone understands the work items in the product backlog
	* give the team clear guidance on which features to deliver next
	* decide when to ship the product with a predisposition towards more frequent delivery
* scrum master
	* Champions for scrum within their teams
	* coach teams, product owners, and business on scrum process
	* fine-tune their practice of it
	* schedules resources for ceremonies

* scrum development team
	* get stuff done
	* tight-knit, co-located, usually five to seven members.
	* have differing skill sets, cross-train each other so no one person becomes a bottleneck.
	* self-organising, have a 'we' attitude
	
scrum focuses on smaller, fixed-length iterations
kanban has the number of tasks to be implemented in the current cycle fixed, then work backwards to calculate how much time to implement these features.
